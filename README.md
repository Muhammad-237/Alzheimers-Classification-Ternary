# Alzheimers Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and can eventually make it difficult to perform simple tasks. It's the most common type of dementia, and usually starts slowly and worsens over time. Symptoms often first appear later in life, and can include:

- Memory problems: Difficulty remembering recent events, or finding the right words
- Vision and spatial issues: Getting lost easily, or putting things in odd places
- Impaired reasoning or judgment: Finding simple things confusing, or developing groundless suspicions
- Trouble doing everyday tasks: Difficulty driving, cooking, or paying bills
- Personality or behavior changes: Becoming more upset, angry, or worried, or losing interest in activities
